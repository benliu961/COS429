## COS429 Final Report: Racial Bias in Image Captioning
Benjamin Liu, Evan Wang

We investigate the prevalence of biases in captions, particularly when images are similar in aspects other than skin-tone, in modern image-captioning systems.

This repository provides the code we implemented for our project. We also work off of a fork of Zhao et. al.'s repo: https://github.com/evan-wang-13/imagecaptioning-bias
